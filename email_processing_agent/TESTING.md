# Email Processing Agent Testing

## Overview
The email processing agent has been successfully implemented and tested. It fetches emails from an IMAP server, normalizes them, and dispatches them to a classification agent.

## Test Results

### Unit Tests (test_agent.py)
All 5 unit tests passed:
- ✓ MIME header decoding
- ✓ Email body extraction (plain text and HTML)
- ✓ Email normalization to standard format
- ✓ Dispatch to classification agent
- ✓ IMAP connection handling

### Integration Test (integration_test.py)
Full workflow test passed:
- ✓ Mock IMAP server connection
- ✓ Processing of 3 different email types:
  - Plain text email
  - HTML email
  - Multipart (text + HTML) email
- ✓ Successful normalization of all emails
- ✓ Successful dispatch to mock classification server
- ✓ Proper email marking as seen

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Configuration Loading**: Reads credentials from .env file
2. **IMAP Support**: Connects to IMAP servers with SSL
3. **Email Normalization**: 
   - Extracts sender, subject, body, and timestamp
   - Converts HTML to plain text using BeautifulSoup
   - Handles MIME-encoded headers
   - Formats timestamps to ISO 8601
4. **Classification Dispatch**: HTTP POST to classification agent
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection and processing errors
6. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
7. **Continuous Polling**: 30-second polling cycle

## Running the Agent

1. Configure your `.env` file with actual IMAP credentials:
   ```
   EMAIL_PROVIDER=IMAP
   IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com
   IMAP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
   IMAP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   CLASSIFICATION_AGENT_URL=http://localhost:8001/classify
   ```

2. Run the agent:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Running Tests

- Unit tests: `python test_agent.py`
- Integration test: `python integration_test.py`

Both test suites run without requiring actual email credentials.
